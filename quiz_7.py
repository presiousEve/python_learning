# Defines two classes, Point() and Disk().
# The latter has an "area" attribute and three methods:
# - change_radius(r)
# - intersects(disk), that returns True or False depending on whether
#   the disk provided as argument intersects the disk object.
# - absorb(disk), that returns a new disk object that represents the smallest
#   disk that contains both the disk provided as argument and the disk object.
