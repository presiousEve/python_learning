# Uses Global Temperature Time Series, avalaible at
# http://data.okfn.org/data/core/global-temp, stored in the file monthly_csv.csv,
# assumed to be stored in the working directory.
# Prompts the user for the source, a year or a range of years, and a month.
# - The source is either GCAG or GISTEMP.
# - The range of years is of the form xxxx -- xxxx (with any number of spaces,
#   possibly none, around --) and both years can be the same,
#   or the first year can be anterior to the second year,
#   or the first year can be posterior to the first year.
# We assume that the input is correct and the data for the requested month
# exist for all years in the requested range.
# Then outputs:
# - The average of the values for that source, for this month, for those years.
# - The list of years (in increasing order) for which the value is larger than that average.
